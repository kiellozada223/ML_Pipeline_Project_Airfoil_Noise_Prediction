#### In this project i developed a modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. Cleaned this dataset, by dropping the duplicate rows, and removing the rows with null values. Created an ML pipeline to create a model that will predict the SoundLevel based on all the other columns. Evaluated the model and towards the end you will persist the model.

## Objectives

#### Part 1 Perform ETL activity
####   - Load a csv dataset
####   - Remove duplicates if any
####   - Drop rows with null values if any
####   - Make transformations
####   - Store the cleaned data in parquet format
#### Part 2 Create a  Machine Learning Pipeline
####   - Create a machine learning pipeline for prediction
#### Part 3 Evaluate the Model
####   - Evaluate the model using relevant metrics
#### Part 4 Persist the Model 
####   - Save the model for future production use
####   - Load and verify the stored model
